   <p>Now days we cannot imagine life without technology thus, we can that it makes life more convenient and simper than past. Information technology brings revolution in our daily life. It increases our standard of living. It has great effect on business, science, education, medical sector, transportation and so on. <p>
   <p>However may be there are some aspects of technology that have negative on our lives, but they are very minor against the benefits of technology. To prove the importance of technology we can say that we cannot live with it but we cannot live without it. I think that everybody is experienced in using technology.  <p>
   <p>  The most important and positive affect of technology on our lives which shows that our life is better than past, is a medical field. The development of any country is measured from the health of its citizens. The invention of x-rays, CT-scans, MRI-scans, and ECG etc. are great achievement of scientist. These inventions are helpful to cure many diseases like diabetes, asthma, HIV, and cancer etc. With the help of technology medical sciences very progressive and there are so many medicines which save many innocents lives. It also improved the health of many people and increases the average life of human beings. In addition with the more and new inventions, it is easily available from poor to rich nations. Advancement in information technology is another example which totally changed our life. Computer is a great invention of a man. It is capable to handle precisely and lot of information at much a speed than unaided human. As we know that every organisation has computerized its tasks, it reduced the use of papers for official work. In earlier days all records are kept in the form of files, which required a lot of paper where as now we can protect a great amount of data in a small hard-disk. The less use of paper also helps to keep the environment clean.<p>
